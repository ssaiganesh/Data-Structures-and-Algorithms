// Data structure is a way in which data is stored on a computer
    // in a specific manner
    // efficient data search and retrieval
    // specific for specific problems
    // manage large amount of data such as large databases and indexing services such as hash table

    // Array is collection of elements of same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by using an
    // index to an unique identifier
    // int numbers[4] = {10, 20 ,30 ,40}

    // Abstract data types are entities that are definitions of data and operations but do not have implementation details

// Algorithms is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations that are carried in a specific
    //  inputs: 0 or more input values
    //  outputs: 1 or more than 1 output
    //  Unambiguity: clear and simple instructions
    //  Finiteness: Limited number of instructions
    //  Effectiveness: Each instruction has an impact on the overall process
